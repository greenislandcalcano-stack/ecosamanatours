      <h2>1. Vision & Mission</h2>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>
        To build a sustainable bridge between responsible tourism and rural families in Samaná,
        creating opportunities, support, and hope within the communities we visit.
      </p>

      <h3>Mission</h3>

      </p>

      <h2>2. Program Structure</h2>

      </ul>

      <h2>3. EcoSamana CARE</h2>

      </p>

      <h2>5. Management & Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        The program will be managed by <strong>EcoSamana Adventures EIRL</strong>, maintaining
        separate accounting records for contributions and project expenses.

        <li>Reports available for MITUR, community leaders, hotels, and project sponsors.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Community Participation</h2>
      <p>
        Community leaders, school directors, rural representatives, and local councils
        will help identify priority needs and monitor project execution. The program’s
        structure is designed to be respectful, collaborative, and culturally aligned.
